# Green Energy Forecast

**[Energy Forecast Dashboard](https://green-energy-forecast.streamlit.app/)**

An end-to-end, serverless Machine Learning system designed to predict hourly power generation for wind and solar assets in Sweden. The system provides **24-hour day-ahead forecasts** at a regional level (SE1–SE4).

## Problem Definition

The objective is to solve a regression problem where the target variable is the power generation (Wind and Solar) for a specific region in Sweden at time $t$.

* **Input:** Historical and forecasted meteorological data (wind speed, irradiance, temperature, cloud cover) together with temporal data (day of year, hour).
* **Target:** Actual aggregated generation data provided by transmission system operators.
* **Horizon:** Day-Ahead (on an hourly level).

## Technical Architecture

The project follows the **Feature-Training-Inference (FTI)** pattern, utilizing a serverless architecture to minimize infrastructure costs while maximizing scalability.

### 1. Feature Engineering Pipeline
This pipeline runs hourly via scheduled cron jobs. Beyond basic ingestion of the weather features, it applies domain-specific transformations to improve model accuracy:

* **Temporal Encoding:** To capture the cyclical nature of energy production, time features are transformed using sin/cos encoding (e.g., hour of day, day of week). This allows the model to understand that hour 23 and hour 00 are chronologically adjacent.
* **Solar Geometry:** We calculate the Sun Elevation Angle and Azimuth for each region. This provides a physical constraint for solar forecasts, helping the model learn that production is impossible when the sun is below the horizon.
* **Wind Power Physics:** We calculate the cube of the wind speed ($v^3$). As the power generated by a wind turbine is theoretically proportional to the cube of the wind velocity, explicitly adding this feature helps the model capture the non-linear relationship between wind speed and energy output.
* **Storage:** Computed features are materialized into the **Hopsworks Feature Store**, providing a consistent offline store for training and a low-latency online store for inference.

### 2. Training Pipeline
Triggered weekly or upon significant data drift, this pipeline:
* Creates a training dataset from the Feature Store.
* Trains separate XGB regression models for each wind and solar per region (SE1–SE4).
* For training, the actual generated energy based on wind and solar is fetched from the [ENTSO-E Transparency Platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu).
* Models are evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R² to ensure performance standards are met.
* Finally, trained models are registered in the **Hopsworks Model Registry** with versioning and metadata for easy retrieval during inference.

### 3. Inference & User Interface
Together with the feature pipeline, the inference runs hourly to fetch the latest weather forecast, retrieve the model from the registry, and generate predictions for the next 24 hours.

The results are visualized in an interactive public dashboard built with **Streamlit**, allowing for real-time comparison between predicted and actual generation across Swedish bidding zones.
The dashboard not only displays forecasts but also provides insights into model performance through historical hindcasts.
